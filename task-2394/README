Visualize self-reported vs. measured bandwidth of relays
========================================================

 - Download consensus and votes from the metrics website, e.g.,

   https://metrics.torproject.org/votes?valid-after=2011-07-13-05-00-00
   https://metrics.torproject.org/consensus?valid-after=2011-07-13-05-00-00

 - Also download the server descriptor archives containing the referenced
   server descriptors from the metrics website.  If the consensus was
   published on the 3rd of a month or later, it's sufficient to download a
   single tarball.  Otherwise, download both tarballs for the current and
   previous month:

   https://metrics.torproject.org/data/server-descriptors-2011-07.tar.bz2

 - Extract the server descriptor tarball(s) into the subdirectory
   descriptors/.  Also copy the consensus and votes there.  With the URLs
   stated above, the directory would contain these files:

     2011-07-13-05-00-00-consensus
     2011-07-13-05-00-00-votes
     server-descriptors-2011-07

 - Download Apache Commons Codec 1.4 or higher and put in in this
   directory.

 - Compile the Java class, e.g.,
   $ javac -cp commons-codec-1.4.jar ParseDescriptors.java

 - Run the Java class, e.g.,
   $ java -cp .:commons-codec-1.4.jar ParseDescriptors

   Once the Java application is done, you'll find a file
   bandwidth-comparison.csv in this directory.

 - Plot the data:

   $ R --slave -f bandwidth-comparison.R

   (Edit bandwidth-comparison.R to color urras or one of the other
   directories specially by putting in the lines containing "purple" and
   re-run the last command above.)
