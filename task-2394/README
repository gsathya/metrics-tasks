Visualize self-reported vs. measured bandwidth of relays
========================================================

 - Download consensuses, votes, and server descriptors from the metrics
   website.  Be sure to download the server descriptors of the month
   preceding the consensuses and votes, too.  For example, you could
   download these files:

   https://metrics.torproject.org/data/votes-2011-01.tar.bz2
   https://metrics.torproject.org/data/consensuses-2011-01.tar.bz2
   https://metrics.torproject.org/data/server-descriptors-2010-12.tar.bz2
   https://metrics.torproject.org/data/server-descriptors-2011-01.tar.bz2

 - Extract the tarballs into subdirectory descriptors/.

 - Download Apache Commons Codec 1.4 or higher and put in in this
   directory.

 - Compile the Java class, e.g.,
   $ javac -cp commons-codec-1.4.jar ParseDescriptors.java

 - Run the Java class, e.g.,
   $ java -cp .:commons-codec-1.4.jar ParseDescriptors

 - Once the Java application is done, you'll find a file
   bandwidth-comparison.csv in this directory.
