Visualize self-reported vs. measured bandwidth of relays
========================================================

 - Download a single consensus and all referenced votes and server
   descriptors from the metrics website, e.g.,

   https://metrics.torproject.org/votes?valid-after=2011-07-13-05-00-00
   https://metrics.torproject.org/consensus?valid-after=2011-07-13-05-00-00
   https://metrics.torproject.org/serverdesc?valid-after=2011-07-13-05-00-00

 - Put all files into a new subdirectory descriptors/.  With the URLs
   stated above, the directory would contain these files:

     2011-07-13-05-00-00-consensus
     2011-07-13-05-00-00-votes
     2011-07-13-05-00-00-descriptors

 - Download Apache Commons Codec 1.4 or higher and put in in this
   directory.

 - Compile the Java class, e.g.,
   $ javac -cp commons-codec-1.4.jar ParseDescriptors.java

 - Run the Java class, e.g.,
   $ java -cp .:commons-codec-1.4.jar ParseDescriptors

   Once the Java application is done, you'll find a file
   bandwidth-comparison.csv in this directory.

 - Plot the data:

   $ R --slave -f bandwidth-comparison.R
