Graphing torperf results and bandwidth authority failures
=========================================================

 - Download the consensus and vote tarballs from the metrics website and
   extract them locally.  You'll want the tarballs since October 2009.

 - Run grep to extract the relevant pieces and save Java the bulk of the
   parsing work.

   $ grep -Rm1 "Measured" votes-20* | cut -c 18-36 | sort | uniq -c
     > votes-measured

   $ grep -Rm1 "^params " consensuses-20* > consensus-params

 - Download the Torperf statistics from the metrics website here:

   https://metrics.torproject.org/csv/torperf.csv

 - Compile and run Eval.java

   $ javac Eval.java && java Eval

 - You should find two files bwscanner-failures.csv and torperf-stats.csv
   in this directory.

 - Run the R code to draw the graph of Torperf results and bwscanner
   outages.  The result will be a new file torperf-bwscanners.pdf.

   $ R --slave -f torperf-bwscanners.R
