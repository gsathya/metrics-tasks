Welcome to the metrics-tasks code repository!

This repository contains technical reports and code snippets for metrics
analyses.  Most of this code was written with the single purpose of
answering a metrics question.  Once it's answered, we're done.  But the
code should be somewhere in case we want to answer a similar question in
the future.  And this "somewhere" shouldn't be someone's desktop.

The rules are simple:

 - Whenever we feel like we want to share technical report sources or
   Java, R, Python code for metrics analyses, we create a new subdirectory
   here.  The naming convention is simply that we use the ticket number
   that Trac assigns as subdirectory name.  For example, code for ticket
   #1234 should go in subdirectory task-1234/.  If there's no Trac ticket
   yet, then why are you working on it?  Go create a Trac ticket first!

 - There should be a README file in every subdirectory saying what the
   code does, what libraries are required, and so on.  Don't spend much
   time on writing a good README, but imagine that you might want to know
   what's going on in 3, 6, or 12 months.

 - Don't check in binaries.  We assume that whoever checks out code from
   this repository knows how to download libraries and compile sources.

 - If we open a follow-up ticket to a ticket that has code in this
   repository, we `git mv` the files and create a tiny text file in the
   original ticket directory saying where the code moved.

 - The code in a ticket may never rely on the code of another ticket in
   this repository.  Consider the subdirectories as small projects that we
   were just too lazy to create new Git repositories for.  Other than that
   subdirectories here have nothing in common.

So much about the rules.  Now go answer fine metrics questions!
