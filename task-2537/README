BridgeDBLogConverter.java

The BridgeDBLogConverter takes BridgeDB's logs as input and writes
(non-sanitized) bridge pool assignments to disk as output.

 - Compile the Java class, e.g.,
   $ javac BridgeDBLogConverter.java

 - If your bridgedb.log file contains log lines from more than one
   calendar year, split it into as many log files as necessary to ensure
   that each file only contains log lines from a single calendar year!

 - Run the Java class, e.g.,
   $ java BridgeDBLogConverter bridgedb.log 2011 assignments.log
