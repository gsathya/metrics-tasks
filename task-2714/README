Purpose:

  These scripts are intended to determine how unstable the set of
  relays with the HSDir flag is.

Dependencies:

  You will need linedemux and linemux installed.  See branch parrun in
  https://gitweb.torproject.org/rransom/tor-utils.git for now.

  You will also need Tcl 8.5.9 and gnuplot 4.4.0 installed.

Instructions:

  First, unpack all of the v3 consensus archive tarballs you want to
  analyze into a single directory, and set the consensus_archive_dir
  environment variable to point to that directory.

  Then run:

    ./generate-consensus-hsdir-lists
    ./compute-hsdir-set-instability
    ./graph-hsdir-set-instability
    ./graph-hsdir-set-absolute-instability

Bugs:

  This code compares each consensus with each of the four following
  consensuses; it should compare each hour's consensus with the
  consensuses in effect in each of the four following hours.
