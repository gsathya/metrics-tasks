Extract bridge fingerprints and byte histories from extra-info
descriptors:

  $ grep -hRE "^extra-info|^write-history|^read-history" extra-infos >
        bridge-bandwidth-histories-raw.txt

Convert the output in something we can sort by fingerprint:

  $ javac OneLinePerDescriptor.java && java OneLinePerDescriptor

Sort by fingerprint and filter out duplicates:

  $ sort bridge-bandwidth-histories-by-fingerprint.txt | uniq >
        bridge-bandwidth-histories-sorted.txt

Aggregate bytes per day:

  $ javac AggregatePerDay.java && java AggregatePerDay

Plot graphs:

  $ R --slave -f eval.R
