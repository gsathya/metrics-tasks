This ticket contains Java and R code to

 a) process bridge and relay data to convert them to a format that is more
    useful for researchers and
 b) verify that the output data files are valid.

This README has a separate section for each Java or R code snippet.

The Java applications produce four output formats containing bridge
descriptors, bridge status lines, bridge pool assignments, and hashed
relay identities.  The data formats are described below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

ProcessSanitizedBridges.java

 - Download sanitized bridge descriptors from the metrics website, e.g.,
   https://metrics.torproject.org/data/bridge-descriptors-2011-01.tar.bz2,
   and extract them in a local directory, e.g., bridge-descriptors/.

 - Download Apache Commons Codec 1.4 or higher and put in in this
   directory.

 - Compile the Java class, e.g.,
   $ javac -cp commons-codec-1.4.jar ProcessSanitizedBridges.java

 - Run the Java class, e.g.,
   $ java -cp .:commons-codec-1.4.jar ProcessSanitizedBridges
     bridge-descriptors/

 - Once the Java application is done, you'll find the two files
   statuses.csv and descriptors.csv in this directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

ProcessSanitizedAssignments.java

 - Download sanitized bridge pool assignments from the metrics website,
   e.g., https://metrics.torproject.org/data/bridge-pool-assignments-2011-01.tar.bz2
   and extract them in a local directory, e.g., bridge-pool-assignments/.

 - Compile the Java class, e.g.,
   $ javac ProcessSanitizedAssignments.java

 - Run the Java class, e.g.,
   $ java ProcessSanitizedAssignments bridge-pool-assignments/

 - Once the Java application is done, you'll find a file assignments.csv
   in this directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

ProcessRelayConsensuses.java

 - Download v3 relay consensuses from the metrics website, e.g.,
   https://metrics.torproject.org/data/consensuses-2011-01.tar.bz2, and
   extract them in a local directory, e.g., consensuses/.

 - Download Apache Commons Codec 1.4 or higher and put in in this
   directory, unless you haven't already done this above for
   ProcessSanitizedBridges.java.

 - Compile the Java class, e.g.,
   $ javac -cp commons-codec-1.4.jar ProcessRelayConsensuses.java

 - Run the Java class, e.g.,
   $ java -cp .:commons-codec-1.4.jar ProcessRelayConsensuses consensuses/

 - Once the Java application is done, you'll find a file relays.csv in
   this directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

verify.R

 - Run the R verification script like this:
   $ R --slave -f verify.R

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

descriptors.csv

The descriptors.csv file contains one line for each bridge descriptor that
a bridge has published.  This descriptor consists of fields coming from
the bridge's server descriptor and the bridge's extra-info descriptor that
was published at the same time.

The columns in descriptors.csv are:

 - descriptor: Hex-formatted descriptor identifier
 - fingerprint: Hex-formatted SHA-1 hash of identity fingerprint
 - published: ISO-formatted descriptor publication time
 - address: Sanitized IPv4 address in dotted notation
 - orport: OR port
 - dirport: Dir port
 - version: Tor version
 - platform: Operating system family (Windows, Linux, etc.)
 - uptime: Uptime in seconds
 - bridgestatsend: ISO-formatted time when stats interval ended
 - bridgestatsseconds: Stats interval length in seconds
 - ??: Unique client IP addresses that could not be resolved
 - a1: Unique client IP addresses from anonymous proxies
 - a2: Unique client IP addresses from satellite providers
 - ad: Unique client IP addresses from Andorra
 - ae: Unique client IP addresses from the United Arab Emirates
 - [...] See ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes
 - zw: Unique client IP addresses from Zimbabwe
 - bridgestatscountries: Number of countries with non-zero unique IPs
 - bridgestatstotal: Total number of unique IPs

There are two sources for the bridgestats* and country-code columns,
depending on Tor's version.  Bridges running Tor version 0.2.1.x or
earlier use dynamic stats intervals from a few hours to a few days.
Bridges running early 0.2.2.x versions published faulty stats and are
therefore removed from descriptors.csv.  Bridges running 0.2.2.x or higher
(except the faulty 0.2.2.x versions) collect stats in 24-hour intervals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

statuses.csv

The statuses.csv file contains one line for every bridge that is
referenced in a bridge network status.  Note that if a bridge is running
for, say, 12 hours, it will be contained in 24 half-hourly published
statuses in that time and will be listed 24 times in statuses.csv.

The columns in statuses.csv are:

 - status: ISO-formatted status publication time
 - fingerprint: Hex-formatted SHA-1 hash of identity fingerprint
 - descriptor: Hex-formatted descriptor identifier
 - published: ISO-formatted descriptor publication time
 - address: Sanitized IPv4 address in dotted notation
 - orport: OR port
 - dirport: Dir port
 - authority: TRUE if bridge has the Authority flag, FALSE otherwise
 - badexit: TRUE if bridge has the BadExit flag, FALSE otherwise
 - baddirectory: TRUE if bridge has the BadDirectory flag, FALSE otherwise
 - exit: TRUE if bridge has the Exit flag, FALSE otherwise
 - fast: TRUE if bridge has the Fast flag, FALSE otherwise
 - guard: TRUE if bridge has the Guard flag, FALSE otherwise
 - named: TRUE if bridge has the Named flag, FALSE otherwise
 - stable: TRUE if bridge has the Stable flag, FALSE otherwise
 - running: TRUE if bridge has the Running flag, FALSE otherwise
 - valid: TRUE if bridge has the Valid flag, FALSE otherwise
 - v2dir: TRUE if bridge has the V2Dir flag, FALSE otherwise

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

assignments.csv

The assignments.csv file contains one line for every running bridge and
the rings, subrings, and buckets that BridgeDB assigned it to.

The columns in assignments.csv are:

 - assignment: ISO-formatted bridge pool assignment time
 - fingerprint: Hex-formatted SHA-1 hash of identity fingerprint
 - type: Name of the distributor: "https", "email", or "unallocated"
 - ring: Ring number, only for distributor "https"
 - port: Port subring
 - flag: Flag subring
 - bucket: File bucket, only for distributor "unallocated"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

relays.csv

The relays.csv file contains SHA-1 hashes of identity fingerprints of
normal relays.  If a bridge uses the same identity key that it also used
as a relay, it might observe more users than it would observe as a pure
bridge.  Therefore, bridges that have been running as relays before should
be excluded from bridge statistics.

The columns in relays.csv are:

 - consensus: ISO-formatted consensus publication time
 - fingerprint: Hex-formatted SHA-1 hash of identity fingerprint
