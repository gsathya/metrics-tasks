Extract sanitized bridge network statuses (not server descriptors or
extra-info descriptors) to bridge-statuses/, e.g.
bridge-statuses/bridge-descriptors-2010-01/statuses/.  Leaving server or
extra-info descriptors in the directory may lead to errors or at least
delay the evaluation significantly.

Compile the Java class:

  $ javac SimulateBridgeStability.java

Run the Java class:

  $ java SimulateBridgeStability

Before re-running, delete the following files/directories to re-generate
them:

  - stable-fingerprints-and-addresses
  - future-stability/
  - stability.csv

Plot the results:

  $ R --slave -f stability.R

The report sources are in tech-reports.git/2011/bridge-stability/.
