Answer the question what fraction of bytes written by relays with the Exit
flag could have used a different address for exiting than the relay used
for registering in the Tor network.
==========================================================================

Clone the metrics-lib repository, create the descriptor.jar file, and put
it in this directory.

Obtain the Apache Commons Codec 1.4 .jar file commons-codec-1.4.jar and
put it in this directory.

Download the metrics tarballs containing consensuses, extra-info
descriptors, and exit lists for a common time period.  Note that the first
and last 2 days of the period won't be usable.  Extract the tarballs and
put them in in/consensuses/, in/extra-infos/, and in/exit-lists/ in this
directory.

Compile the Java class:

  $ javac -cp descriptor.jar AnalyzeDifferentExitAddress.java

Run the Java class:

  $ java -cp descriptor.jar:commons-codec-1.4.jar:. \
    AnalyzeDifferentExitAddress

In order to re-run parts of the analysis, delete files in status/ or the
results file in out/.

Aggregate the results using R and ggplot2:

  $ R --slave -f different-exit-address-1.R

Draw graphs using R and ggplot2:

  $ R --slave -f different-exit-address-2.R
