Thematic Mapping API prototype for Tor metrics data
---------------------------------------------------

 - Download the Thematic Mapping API JavaScript code from
   http://thematicmapping.org/ and place it in this directory.  In
   particular, you'll need tmapi-0.1.js and worldborders.js.

 - Create your own Google Spreadsheet and replace the link
   "https://spreadsheets.google.com/tq?key=0AujpbDQoBXkX..." in index.html
   with a link to your spreadsheet.  Feel free to use the existing link,
   but note that you cannot change the data in it.

 - Register your domain at Google for using the Google Earth Plug-In on
   your website.  If you don't, the plugin won't load on your website, but
   it will tell you where to register.

 - Make your website available via thttpd, Apache, or the web server of
   your choice.
